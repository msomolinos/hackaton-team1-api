# You can use a RUN command to "touch" the jar file so that it has a file modification time (Docker creates all container files in an "unmodified" state by default).
# This actually isnâ€™t important for the simple app that we wrote, but any static content (e.g. "index.html") would require the file to have a modification time.
RUN bash -c 'touch /app.jar'

# To reduce Tomcat startup time we added a system property pointing to "/dev/urandom" as a source of entropy.
